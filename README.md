# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-using-Machine-Learning-
The project revolves around the application of machine learning for medical diagnosis, specifically in the context of breast cancer detection. Using a dataset loaded from a CSV file, the project aims to predict whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This predictive task has significant implications for healthcare and is a critical step in early cancer diagnosis.

The project begins by loading the dataset and performing essential data preprocessing, which includes mapping the categorical diagnosis labels to numerical values for modeling. After this initial step, the data is divided into training and testing sets to ensure the model's effectiveness.

A key aspect of this project is the selection and evaluation of multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. These models are rigorously evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, with classification accuracy as the chosen evaluation metric. The comparison of these models through cross-validation helps identify the most suitable algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis.

After the model selection and evaluation phase, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen as the final model due to its promising performance. The SVM is trained on the training data, and its ability to predict tumor diagnoses is tested using the test data. This final step is vital in ensuring the model's generalizability and real-world applicability.

The project provides valuable insights into the power of machine learning in the medical field, specifically for early cancer diagnosis. It showcases the process of model selection, evaluation, and testing to make informed decisions about the choice of algorithms for a critical healthcare application. Accurate predictions can help medical professionals identify malignancies promptly, improving patient outcomes and saving lives.
